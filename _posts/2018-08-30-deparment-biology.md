The society’s Biology Department offers a variety of interactive activities; from learning how to code programs that analyse DNA bases to decorating and planting herb pots, our department focuses on a wide range of different biology-related events each week. Including the various happenings that our members can take part in, we will be spending a sufficient amount of time on planning and brainstorming for potential research projects, so that everyone can have a chance in running a EUYSRA funded investigation. The members of the department play an important role in determining each week’s activity in order to make it interesting and relevant to everybody. We are always open to new suggestions and look forward to what the next year holds for our department!

**Notable previous projects:**
- Studying the importance of Mycorrhizal fungi on plant growth.
- Developing methods to measure differences between ion concentrations in different plant organs in comparison to soil ion concentrations.
