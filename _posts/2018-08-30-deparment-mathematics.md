The Mathematics Department aims to showcase mathematics from a more relaxed and fun point of view, to make members more curious about mathematics as a subject and a profession. Activities can include stressbuster colouring sessions with the Collatz conjecture, talks from professors at the university, or discovering the mathematics behind music. We will have several co-operations with MathSoc and the Problem Solving Group throughout the academic year. We also aim to provide members with opportunities to get an insight into what it’s like to research in mathematics.
