**Head of department:** Ana PuljiÄ‡, MA Philosophy and Psychology, 4th year  

**Psychology committee:**  
- Emily Dawson, MA Linguistics and Psychology, 4th year

**Meeting place:**  TBA

**Meeting time:** TBA

The meetings of the Psychology and Linguistics Department happen on a weekly basis, with each meeting having a different activity: ranging from reading groups and discussions about articles on a given topic to presentations and talks from older undergraduates and postgraduates on the process of developing your research topic, creating the appropriate experimental design, finding a supervisor etc. The meetings are flexible to the extent that members are always encouraged to give feedback and suggestions about what they want to do or hear. The aim is to bring psychological and linguistic research closer to students and let them experience doing it first-hand even before their final year thesis.

**Notable previous projects:**  
- Relationship between psychopathy and leadership  
- Variation of the Asch conformity experiments
- Perceptual learning with diminished attention to the stimulus
