**Head of department:** Andrea Husseiniova

**Meeting place:**  TBA

**Meeting time**: TBA

The Physics department aims to help undergraduates set up their own research projects. We will brainstorm project ideas during our meetings and let members form small groups to research the most interesting ideas. Groups typically consist of members from different years (including 1st years!) and different degree programmes, so anyone can take part! The department head will help with finding a suitable project supervisor and applying for EUYSRA funding.  

Interdisciplinary projects are highly encouraged, so engineers and mathematicians are more than welcome too!  

Notable previous projects:  
- Students calculated how solar sail degradation would shorten the flight time of a sail-equipped satellite at Mars or Venus. The team's results were published in a [mainstream journal](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.G000465?journalCode=jgcd), alongside the satellite trajectory calculations.

- A group of students is working on building an n-body model to describe exoplanetary systems using existing survey data. This will allow them to create a small catalogue of exoplanetary systems.
- A team of students constructed their own radio telescope to study solar flares.
